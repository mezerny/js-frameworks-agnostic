#Client side

##Invoice form
Since our products do not have image or description, I've decided to use simple table to browse all the products.
It is easy to add pagination in the future if necessary (when API gets more robust)
I've decided not to remove spinner arrows for amount control (just didn't want to spend time on that, could be removed with CSS)
